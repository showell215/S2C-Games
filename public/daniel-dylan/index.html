    <!-- 1) Let's set a page background color. Go to this site to pick a good background color (find something that is pretty light so black text will show up) : https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp 
  Once you pick a color, give the <body> tag a class name of your choice (remember class="whatever-class-name-you-want...". Then, go to the CSS section, create that class name there, and set background-color to your color choice. -->
  <h1 class="main-title">About Zeus</h1>
  <p class="quote"> <em>I am GOD</em></p>
  <!-- 2) put your favorite quote here inside <em></em> tags (<em> makes it itallic. -->
  <!-- 3) Give your quotes tag the class name "quote", and then use the same CSS as the <h1> with the "main-page" class to center your quote -->
  
  <!-- 4) choose your profile image and put it here using an <img> tag-->
  <!-- 5) give your profile image a CSS class name of "profile-image", and make it 200 pixels wide (hint: you can use `width: 200px` inside your CSS class to do this) -->

    <!-- 6) add 4 more facts about you here, using the above as a guide. For example- birthday, favorite food, hobbies, etc. -->
    <!-- 7) see how the <ul> tag has a class name of 'about-me'?  In the CSS section, find that class, and give it a new background color of your choice. You can go to the same site as in step 1) to pick a background -->
  </ul>
  <!-- 8) Just like in the example, let's line our facts and image up to the left using the 'float' CSS property. HINT: in CSS, `float: left` makes stuff move as far left as they can go-->
  
  <!-- 9)  Just like with our profile image and "Fast facts" section, make a list of your favorite quotes usiing the <ul> and <li> tags.-->
